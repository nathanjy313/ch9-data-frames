# Exercise 2: working with data frames

# Create a vector of 100 employees ("Employee 1", "Employee 2", ... "Employee 100")
# Hint: use the `paste()` function and vector recycling to add a number to the word
# "Employee"
one_to_hundred <- seq(1:100)
paste("Employee", one_to_hundred)

# Create a vector of 100 random salaries for the year 2017
# Use the `runif()` function to pick random numbers between 40000 and 50000
random_salaries <- runif(100, 40000, 50000)


# Create a vector of 100 salaries in 2018 that have changed from 2017
# Use `runif()` to add a random number between -5000 and 10000 to each of 2017's
# salaries (the negative number means that a salary may have decreased!)
random_salaries_2018 <- random_salaries + runif(100, -5000, 10000)


# Create a data frame 'salaries' by combining the 3 vectors you just made
# Remember to set `stringsAsFactors=FALSE`!
salaries <- data.frame(one_to_hundred, random_salaries, random_salaries_2018, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Create a column 'change' that stores each person's change in salary between
# 2017 and 2018
salaries$change <- random_salaries_2018 - random_salaries

# Create a column 'got_raise' that is TRUE if the person got a raise (their
# salary went up)
salaries$got_raise <- salaries$change > 0


### Retrieve values from your data frame to answer the following questions
### Note that you should get the value as specific as possible (e.g., a single
### cell rather than the whole row!)

# What was the 2018 salary of employee 57
employee_57 <- salaries["57", "random_salaries_2018"]

# How many employees got a raise?
nrow(salaries[salaries$got_raise == TRUE, ])

# What was the dollar value of the highest raise?
most_raise <- max(salaries$change)

# What was the "name" of the employee who received the highest raise?
best_employee <- salaries["most_raise", "one_to_hundred"]

# What was the largest decrease in salaries between the two years?
most_decrease <- min(salaries$change)

# What was the name of the employee who recieved largest decrease in salary?
least_employee <- salaries["most_decrease", "one_to_hundred"]

# What was the average salary change?
avg_change <- mean(salaries$change)

# For people who did not get a raise, how much money did they lose on average?


## Consider: do the above averages match what you expected them to be based on 
## how you generated the salaries?

# Write a .csv file of your salary data to your working directory
